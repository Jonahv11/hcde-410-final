I have no idea what analytical methods I would use to answer my questions, I assumed I would just do it and answer my questions the best I could with figures using the data.
I would probably either use a map or a data table to display my findings, as either would make it very easy to juxtapose electric vehicle ownership with other demographic factors. However, a scatterplot would probably work very well to display my findings, as I could compare 3 variables at once using the color of the data points on the plot. I guess how I display the data depends on how the work goes, and how well it would look in each situation.
I may have to clean my data sets a little bit, but looking at my data set from the DOL, I expect my other data sets to be clean as well, considering they are also involved with governmental organizations.
From there, I would concatenate my data frames, and make a column for the percentage of the population owning EVs (I would just divide total registration by population, since there is no surefire way to account for one owner of multiple EVs, and that would still be representative of the sentiment of the region).
Once I have data from the sets in a matching dataframe, it would be an easy job of plotting the data. Like I said, how I present the data depends on what's happening with the data, but I'm inclined to try a scatterplot first.
