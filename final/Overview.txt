I am hoping to gauge some aspect of how much people give a shit about climate change. In this project, I am making the assumption that most people who care about climate change see driving an electric vehicle as a step in the right direction, rather than being aware of the exploitative industry involving lithium and cobalt mining and refusing to partake in that economy. 
With this project, I want to first look at concentrations of people who own electric vehicles by slicing open the dataset that I talked about in the description file. Then I plan on comparing this data to other data about people in Washington state, such as voting records or tax information.
An example of a research question for each of these routes of inquiry would be:
How does electric vehicle ownership align with the typical voter distribution of a region within Washington state?
How does electric vehicle ownership compare to income and other tax information by region in Washington state?
And each hypothesis:
In areas with more democratic and green party voters, there will be higher electric vehicle ownership, and vice versa for areas with more republican and libertarian voters.
Wealthier areas surrounding urban zones will have higher rates of electric vehicle ownership than poorer rural areas.
