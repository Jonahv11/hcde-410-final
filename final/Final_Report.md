### **Abstract**
I wanted to look at something pertaining to climate change. I found a good dataset on electric vehicle registration in Washington State. I hypothesized that registration would increase as time went on, and analyzed both hybrid and fully electric vehicles with a stacked plot. I found the data supports my hypothesis, but I can't make many in-depth observations off the data, since I don't have anything else I'm comparing it with. While it proved difficult to corroborate this data, I believe it would produce worthwile results.

### **Motivation**
This study is about electric vehicle ownership in Washington State. My academic passion is climate change, and I am constantly seeking new angles to learn about how we influence the planet, or how we are fixing the problems we are causing. While electric vehicle ownership isn't conclusive as an indicator about whether someone cares about climate change, I believe it is useful as a piece of evidence, and can be analyzed on a societal level. I think analysis would shed light on how much priority is being placed by corporations or governments on climate change. While I found a very comprehensive dataset from the Washington State DOL, I haven't found much in-depth analysis on electric vehicle ownership, such as comparing it to other trends.

### **Introduction**
When I first looked at this dataset, I was impressed by the neatness and comprehensiveness of it. I believed it would be easy to find other things recorded by the US government, such as state/county-wide voting statistics, or income and/or tax spreads. I wanted to compare electric vehicle ownership to these two factors, as I had an educated hypothesis about comparing each factor on its own, but I believed that comparing all three factors together could show a more interesting result. However, after searching for a considerable amount of time, I couldn't find any CSV's that I could combine with my initial dataset, and I was forced to analyze data within a single dataset, which isn't as exciting. If I had more time, I would do some more digging for additional datasets, but as I had to stay in one dataset, I wanted to look at popularity of electric vehicles over time, which I could accomplish using the model year of the registered vehicles. Admittedly, this statistic is not the same as the purchasing date, but that wasn't on the data set. Differences between model year and purchasing date could be influenced by the higher price of brand new cars, market trends based on resource availability, and much more. But I figured that most electric vehicles are purchased new, and the differences caused by these factors would skew the data, but not render it ineffective. I continued my project with this assumption, and looked into popularity of electric vehicles over the years in Washington State.
I hypothesized that the popularity of electric vehicles would increase over time, as they saturate the market and occupy more financial niches for a wider spread of Americans.

### **Methodology**
I am not experienced with statistical analysis. As someone new to the data science world, my main efforts lie with creating interpretable figures using the data, and looking at the figures and seeing what conclusions I can draw from them. In this project, I created a stacked plot with hybrid and fully electric vehicles separated by color, and plotted them against model year from the registration dataset. The dataset had cars registered all the way back to 1997, but for the figure I sliced out the years before 2010, since those years had so few data points that they skewed the figure without providing valuable information. 

### **Findings**
As I hypothesized, the overall popularity of electric vehicles had increased over time in Washington state, with every year besides 2019 showing an increase above the last year. But while the aggregate sum of electric vehicles purchased showed a clear trend, the popularity of hybrid-electric vehicles didn't follow the same path. Popularity of hybrids has certainly increased since 2010, but not as decisively as fully electric vehicles. The peak of hybrid vehicle purchasing was from the model year of 2018.

### **Discussion**
The data supports my hypothesis, but I have to state that there are other reasons why more people would buy more electric vehicles than simply caring about climate change. The probable largest factor in the increased purchasing of electric vehicles would be the financial incentive. A decade ago, electric vehicles were expensive, somewhat impractical, and didn't control the market enough to receive perks like widespread charging stations. But since then, the vehicles have expanded to a wider consumer base, established precedence with electric-vehicle specific parking and charging stations, and become cheaper than gasoline cars in many cases. Charging an electric car is about a third the price of filling up a tank of gas. So I can't chalk this trend down to people giving more of a shit about climate change than they did 10 years ago. However, I do think these results say something about the state of our market. Climate solutions are starting to appear, and when they are profitable, they receive widespread support. Capitalism is a single-minded entity, but innovators are starting to harness capitalism's single-mindedness to solve problems. Tesla created a product, and that product paved the way for an entirely new industry. This data shows the development of that industry, rather than simply the purchasing whims of individuals in Washington State (which does still have an impact on purchasing).
Since I didn't have other datasets I was analyzing, this project was limited in its breadth and scope, making it harder for me to look at the purchaser rather than the supplier. But this data still clearly shows the expansion of electric vehicles as an industry, and shows that corporations are caring about this issue related to climate change, even if it isn't necessarily for the right reasons. Further studies in this field would do well to compare registration with census population data, to compare registration with monetary statistics or voting statistics, and to compare registration with education statistics.

### **Conclusion**
Popularity of electric vehicles has risen over time. I cannot conclude that this is due to the fact that the American consumer cares more about climate change. But I can conclude that the issue of electric vehicles has become more important to our economy, albeit it's due to profit incentive. It appears that climate change needs to be met with profitable innovations to be solved in today's society, rather than regulations and policy reform. However, I might be pessimistic. I am not impressed with what our society has done so far.
