After browsing the internet for demographic work being done on electric vehicle ownership, I stumbled onto something relatively similar to my research question. I saw an article on current EV registration by US state. This article showed the total number of EV registrations from each state, as well as the proportion of national EV registration from each state. As I would have expected, it appears that blue states such as California and Washington have higher rates of EV registration than more conservative states. However, I had to make these assumptions based on educated guesses using my personal knowledge of the population of states, such as California's, as well as my prior knowledge of what constitutes a blue state and what constitutes a red state. My project would elucidate these relationships and make the connection for the viewer. I would probably ignore the total number of registration all together, and instead base my data off proportion to the total population.
The website I'm comparing my idea to is this: https://electrek.co/2022/08/24/current-ev-registrations-in-the-us-how-does-your-state-stack-up/
